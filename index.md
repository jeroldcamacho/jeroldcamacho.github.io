Passionate Computer Science graduate with 3 years of experience in Penetration Testing specifically in Web Application Security. I have been acknowledged on several websites such as Google, Microsoft, and Adobe for reporting web security vulnerabilities. I also play CTF competitions with my team [joyuriz](https://ctftime.org/team/163844) on my free time.
